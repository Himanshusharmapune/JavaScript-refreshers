Forin loop is used to iterate over objects( as for of loop is used to iterate over arrays and maps and strings) but we can use for in loop for arrays as well.
.filter is used is filter out some values from the array
.map() is used to create a new array by performing some operation on each element of the original array for engine. we can add 10 to each element of the array using Map

#very Imp
array.map() and map is different as array.map() is for making a new array from another array by applying logic to every item and Map object (with set and get) is a box where you store things with a label (key) and then fetch them using that label.
